# readme

Start with practicing the photos I have added to the folder,
just to be clear you do not need to use the photos I have added. Draw what ever you want you draw when you want to draw, these are for if you dont have anything or dont know where to start.

Next you can find some other photos you would want to look at and recreate ones youre interested in.
Or draw characters from your favourite media, pinterest is a good resource.

The ones I have added are supposed to be pretty like "simple" references so you dont have to focus on too much detail. When youre working on these just try to do the best you can on the main subject and dont worry about the background or side stuff.

Next you can also try drawing stuff around you, mouse, banana, light switch whatever.

Feel free to draw over existing photos to get a feel for drawing with shapes and stuff, circles, squares, lines.

Final thing would be to work with imagining things, its not totally important but its nice to practice a little of. Just know the stuff you do from memory will look worse than your normal stuff, but sometimes you will draw the best thing youve ever drawn on the side of a piece of paper and never be able to recreate anything close to it.

Once you work through those I would try these resources for practice. Some of them might be too long and boring so you dont have to do everything but I have some vidoes from Sinix which are very good.

drawabox.com also looks like it would be good so try that one out.
